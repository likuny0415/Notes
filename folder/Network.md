# Network

### 1.1 A day in the life of an application

##### WWW (world wide wed)

Throught `http`, two servers can **send request** and **receive response** from another servers

##### Bittorrent

The most easiest way for two computers to transfer information is by streaming, which two computers can transfer information bi-direction, they can both `read` and `write` data to each other. This build connectivity graphs

##### Skype

Sometimes clients are behind **NAT** which clients can send request to other servers, but server can't send request to the client, so in order for two clients to communicate, they connect to **relay** and through relay to build connection and sending data.



### 1.2 The four layers Internet model

##### Four layer hierarchy

Application -> Transport -> Network -> Link

##### Link layer

Link layer do the job to build connection to other link and routers

##### Network layer

[Data, from, to] build blocks and store data, and transfer data through link layer, through link layer, it transfers datadiagram for network to receivce and continue transfer data blocks if it is the `destination`
